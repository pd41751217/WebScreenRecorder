## Installation & Usage

### Quick Start
1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
3. Grant camera and microphone permissions when prompted
4. Start recording!

### Local Development
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd browser-recorder
   ```

2. Serve the files using a local server (required for media APIs):
   ```bash
   # Using Python 3
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Using Node.js
   npx serve .
   
   # Using PHP
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```

3. Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser

### Production Deployment
For production deployment, ensure you're serving the files over HTTPS, as most browsers require a secure context for media APIs.
